Prebuilt invoice template
The fields used in invoice template will receive details from Sample Superstore dataset (excel file).

I will be using python for data analysis and creating invoices for each customer. The invoices will be prepared in excel and then will be converted into pdf.

Invoice/Receipt No. can be added later if required.
Code to capture log for status and error can be added.

Folder Structure:
Source Folder: It contains Sample Superstore dataset and invoice template.
Invoices Folder: It will contain invoice created using python code. The invoice file name will have name in the format Customer Name_Order ID.xlsx.

Python Libraries used are as follows:
pandas
openpyxl

Please see "Inv_1.py" for more details.

# Known Issues:
Logo is missing in newly created invoices.
