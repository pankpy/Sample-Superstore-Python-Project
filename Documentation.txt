Prebuilt invoice template
The fields used in invoice template will receive details from Sample Superstore dataset (excel file).

I will be using python for data analysis and creating invoices for each customer. The invoices be prepared in excel and then will be converted into pdf.

Invoice/Receipt No. can be added later if required.

Folder Structure:
Source Folder: It contains Sample Superstore dataset and invoice template.

Invoices Folder: It will contain invoice created using python code. The invoice fill name will have name in the format Order ID_Customer Name.xlsx.


Python Libraries used are as follows:
pandas
openpyxl
pywin32 (win32com.client)
